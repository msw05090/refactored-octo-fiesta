#Data Set Description 
This dataset was found on data.gov. It includes the attendance rate for public school students PK-12 by student group and by district during the 2021-2022 school year. The student groups include those experiencing homelessness, disabilities, those who qualify for free/reduced lunch, English learners, all high needs students (includes students who are English language learners, who receive special education or qualify for free and reduced lunch), and non-high needs students. It also lists students by their race/ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino of any race, Black or African American, White, and all other races). Attendance rates are provided for each student group by their district and for the state. The data columns consist of the categories of students, the locations, districts, attendance rates, student counts, and reporting periods. When no attendance data is displayed in a cell, the data has been suppressed to safeguard student confidentiality, or it ensures that statistics that are based on a very small sample size are not interpreted as equally representative as those based on a sufficiently larger sample size.
